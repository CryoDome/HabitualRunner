<h1>Habitual Runner</h1>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
    Habitual Runner is an endless runner-platformer game developed by the fake video game company CryoDome. It was developed using the Python programming language, and images, animations, sounds and music stolen (I mean borrowed) off of the internet. The game is played using the arrow keys, and the goal is to avoid falling to your death and being killed by the giant crab monster for as long as possible.
